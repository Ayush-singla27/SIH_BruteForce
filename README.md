### Equipment

---

In game presented two types of equipment: body armor and military helmet. Helmet will protect your head and face (if visor is down) against fragments and small calibers. In game you have only one type of helmet - Altyn. Very protective helmet, but it dampens noises a lot outside the helmet, so after putting it on in the game you will hear sounds worse.
Body armor saves you from grenade fragments and absorbs and dissipates energy of bullets on impact. Current body armor in game - Gzhel. The Gzhel assault bulletproof vest is designed for assault units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and other law enforcement agencies. Lightweight and excellent protection against direct hits thanks to ceramic plates.

## Controllers Bindings

You will need to configure your bindings to play this game. For Oculus Quest 2 you can find it by this link. ([Oculus Bindings](/ControllerBindings/shootings_range_vr_oculus_quest_2.json))
You need to allocate two buttons with simple "Button" specialization. For example on Oculus it will be "A", "B" and "X" & "Y". More information on my controllers bindings on image below.
